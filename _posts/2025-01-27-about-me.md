title: About Me
---

Hi! I love turning my ideas into reality through programming.  
I’m constantly working on toy projects whenever inspiration strikes.  
Delving into system hacking techniques made me realize that it requires much broader and deeper knowledge than development, demands creativity, and offers boundless opportunities for growth.  
This has motivated me to pursue a path as a security researcher rather than remain a software developer.
